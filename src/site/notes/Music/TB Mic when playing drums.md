I'm using the SE V7, which is a dynamic microphone with supercardioid pattern.

I'm also using a PB-05 created by [Optogate](https://Optogate.com), which is an IR proximity sensor that switches on the mic when I'm close. This way my hands and feet can be free to do other stuff.

## Issues

- It seems likes the PB-05 is quite suspectible to interference.
- Two-tone note is played when PB-05 is switching off.

I've sent an email to the manufacturer, asking for help with these issues.

## Settings in my Presonus 32R mixer.

- Pre set to 30dB. 
	- Normal gain staging for the mic
- HPF 50
	- Normal 
- Gate Threshould  -70.
	- Seems to remove the interference noise when the PB-05 is off.

- Also smart to add some compression?

I'm not sure how to get rid of the two-tone-note. So I'm just going to use this as a talkback mic for now.
