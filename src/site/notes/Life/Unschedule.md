# The "unschedule" method
read https://www.njlifehacks.com/the-unschedule-procrastination/

There are 7 points to this

## 1. Schedule Only:
- [ ] Previously committed time such as meals, sleep, meetings
- [ ] Free time, recreation, leisure time
- [ ] Socializing, lunches and dinners with friends
- [ ] Health activities such as swimming, running, tennis, working out at the gym
- [ ] Routine structured events such as commuting time, classes, medical appointments

This is the very basic principle of unscheduling. You do not fill your calendar with any work. Instead, you fill it with as many non-work related activities as possible.

> Making sure you spend more time engaging in guilt-free play creates another interesting side effect – it changes how you see work. Right now, your thinking probably goes something like this, “First comes work, then I can do something fun.” Sounds good, but the problem is that for procrastinators, the ‘something fun’ part never actually comes. Procrastinators don’t know where their time goes, feel guilty for thinking they wasted time, feel that they don’t deserve any rest, and thus never really allow themselves any guilt-free leisure time.
