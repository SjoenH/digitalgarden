Remember this feeling, how being new and insecure in a new situation, be it a new work-environment or meeting a new group of people. This feeling lingers for a while, but will gradually decrease as we find our place.

Note, this process may be eased if we are reaffirmed by someone that we look up to.

So, remember this, and try to look out for those who are new and vulnerable. Give words of encouragement and let them know when they do a good job.
