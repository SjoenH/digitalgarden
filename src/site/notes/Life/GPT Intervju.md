Q: Tell me a little bit about yourself. 
A: Hi there! My name is Henry, and I'm an IT consultant. I work for Miles, where I focus on frontend web projects. In my personal life, I have a lovely wife and a newborn child. I also enjoy playing drums and being creative in my free time.

Q: What are your interests and hobbies? 
A: In addition to spending time with my family, I really enjoy playing drums and being creative. I find that music and art are great outlets for me to express myself and relax.

Q: What do you do for a living? 
A: As I mentioned, I work as an IT consultant for Miles. I mostly work on frontend web projects, but I'm willing to take on whatever tasks are needed to get the job done, whether that means working on the back-end or taking on a leadership role. I also have a background in user experience design, so I often offer my thoughts on how to improve the user experience of a project.

Q: What are your goals for the future? 
A: In the future, I hope to continue to improve my skills in design and communication. I believe that these skills are essential for success in my field, and I want to continue to grow and learn in these areas. I also want to be a loving and supportive husband and father to my family.

Q: What do you think makes you unique? 
A: I'm not sure that uniqueness is all that important in the grand scheme of things. I believe that what really matters is being able to work well with others, and to find the best in others and ourselves. That being said, I think my background in both IT and the arts gives me a unique perspective that allows me to approach problems in a creative and innovative way. And of course, my wonderful family is a huge part of what makes me who I am.
