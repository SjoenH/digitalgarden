# Coffee <3 Life
Coffee is ingrained in my life. It's important to me, and there are several reasons for it.

## Social
I would be lying if this is the reason I drink. It's more an excuse. But preparing a cup of coffee for visitors or grabbing a coffee with someone is something I cherish.

I've grown up in a space of strong social pressure to drink coffee. Though I've never felt like that is why I drink it.

I actually like the taste (most of the time).

## Alertness
Feel alive and well.

## The Taste
It's Good as long as it is good coffee.
