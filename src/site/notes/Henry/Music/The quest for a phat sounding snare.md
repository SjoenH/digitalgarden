# The quest for a phat sounding snare

To get

## Get a deep snare.
Tama has this great cheap snare from the "Sound Lab Project" which is 14 x 8. They say it's a limited-run, but it's been in stock for many years and can be bought for around 2500 Nok.

## Heads

Might look best with a white head, but a hydraulic head would give a more damped or controlled sound.

## Strands
Try out 42 strands for extra "sensitivity" - or whatever that means.


## Tuning

Bottom head: 400 hz
Top head: 200 hz on the ring.

## Damping

Depends on how low and controlled sound you want... 
Some use the Evans e-ring.
