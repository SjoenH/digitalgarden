# Interface
An interface defines a contract. Any [`class`](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/keywords/class) or [`struct`](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/builtin-types/struct) that implements that contract must provide an implementation of the members defined in the interface. - From [the docs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/keywords/interface)

---
An interface itself does not have any implementation-logic. Only defines what should be implemented by others (by inheriting this class).
