# C# - See Sharp
## A big disclaimer
Hello, this is my jottings about C#. It's quite incomplete, and should not be used as a reference. Go to the [proper docs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/) for that. 

**In the future,** I hope to share something of use to help others see sharp (Sorry for the pun. [[Life/I'm a Dad now|I'm a Dad now]]), but *for now*, this might **blur your vision** instead. 

**You have been warned.**
