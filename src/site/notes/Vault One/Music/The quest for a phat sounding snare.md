# The quest for a phat sounding snare

To get 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8Cbg0F3q7M


## Get a deep snare.
Tama has this great cheap snare from the "Sound Lab Project" which is 14 x 8. They say it's a limited-run, but it's been in stock for many years and can be bought for around 2500 Nok.

## Heads

Might look best with a white head, but a hydraulic head would give a more damped or controlled sound.

## Strands
Try out 42 strands for extra "sensitivity" - or whatever that means.


## Tuning

Bottom head: 400 hz
Top head: 200 hz on the ring.

## Damping

Depends on how low and controlled sound you want... 
Some use the Evans e-ring.

Larnell Lewis have this hybrid snare/tom. Which might be something I'm interested in doing...

TOP: Evans hydraulic head
BOTTOM: Evans Hazy 300

He mentions that it's important to have a thin head on the bottom for snare sensitivity....

Tuning:
He starts it really low. And tune slowly up untill he get's the wrinkles out. Then he finds a couple of lugs that have the pitch he is looking for. And adjusts the other ones to match.

For the bottom head, he makes sure it's not too loose or too tight... What does that mean?
