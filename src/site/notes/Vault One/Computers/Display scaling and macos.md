4k on a 32" monitor is generally not a good fit for text and other productivity tasks, as the text either will be too small to comfortably read or too large if you apply 2x-scaling.

For me, using a "Scaled resolution", and putting it in the middle makes it all work fine, but this does affect performance of the machine.

So lesson learned. If you want a new display and are using macOS, then a 4k on a 24" is probably your best buy, since a 2x scaling would work without it looking weird or having a bad performance impact.

For "Native"-performance. Look for a display that has a PPI of an integer multiple of 110, like 220.

But how big is the performance hit?


## Revised article Display Scaling and macOS

Using a 4k display on a 32" monitor is generally not a good fit for text and other productivity tasks. The text will either be too small or too large when using 2x-scaling. This is because a 4k display on a 32" monitor has a lower pixels per inch (PPI) value, which can make text and other fine details difficult to see.

For me, using a "Scaled resolution" and putting it in the middle works fine. However, this does affect the performance of the machine. On older, Intel-based Macs, using a high resolution can cause the fan to spin, and adding scaling on top just makes it worse. On newer M1-based Macs, the performance hit is not as significant.

Therefore, if you want a new display and are using macOS, a 4k on a 24" is probably your best choice. A 2x scaling will work without making the image look weird or impacting performance.

For "Native"-performance, look for a display that has a PPI of an integer multiple of 110, such as 220. You can find more information about this at [https://www.sven.de/dpi/](https://www.sven.de/dpi/).

## Performance

But how big is the performance hit when using a "Scaled resolution" on a Mac? This is difficult to answer without knowing the specific specifications of your machine and the display you are using. However, in general, using a scaled resolution will require your machine to do more work to render the images on the screen, which can impact performance. This is because the scaled resolution increases the number of pixels that your machine must process, which can strain its resources.

On older, Intel-based Macs, the performance impact of using a scaled resolution can be significant. On newer M1-based Macs, the performance hit is not as significant.

Overall, consider the PPI value of a display when using it with a Mac, as well as the performance impact of using different display scaling options. By choosing a display with an appropriate PPI value and using the appropriate scaling setting, you can optimize your setup for productivity and performance.
