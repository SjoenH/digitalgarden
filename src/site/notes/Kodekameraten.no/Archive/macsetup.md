I've been thinking about how to automate the process of making a new mac feel at home for me.
So I've customized a script that does exactly that!

This is shamelessly inspired by, and most of the stuff is a straight copy from [bradp](https://github.com/bradp).

> Most likely you don't want my *exact* setup, but feel free to take a look and rip off what you like! ðŸ™ƒ
You can [find my repo here](https://github.com/SjoenH/macSetup/tree/master).

To use it, just run this line in your terminal.
```bash
curl -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SjoenH/macSetup/master/setup.sh | sh
```
