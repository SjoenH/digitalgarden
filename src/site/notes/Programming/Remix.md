## Styling components
My mental model for styling is different than what Remix acts like as default. CSS is not module-scoped, but url route-scoped.  That means you need to add the link-tag on a route and import the css-file instead of in a component. 

So it feels a bit weird at first. Thus I went with Tailwind, which has it's own learning-curve, but it's not too bad.

## Routing
Folder router is a bit weird as well... but really powerfull when you get used to it.
